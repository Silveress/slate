# Introduction

Valid for 3.x.x

Welcome to the Unoffical BnS API! You can use my API which can get information on items, characters and marketplace info.

Headers are on the left, more detailed info on the endpoints in the center and the outputs on the right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate).
